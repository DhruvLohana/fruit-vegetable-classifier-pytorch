# 🍎 Fruit & Vegetable Classifier (EfficientNet-B4 + Streamlit)

This project is a web app that classifies images of fruits and vegetables using a fine-tuned **EfficientNet-B4** model trained with PyTorch. The app is built using **Streamlit** for quick and interactive predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload an image of a fruit or vegetable
- Get **real-time prediction** with high confidence (95%+ accuracy)
- Built with **PyTorch**, **TorchVision**, and **Streamlit**
- Runs locally or can be deployed to Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🖼️ Example

Upload an image like this:

![example fruit image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Red_Apple.jpg)

And get output like:

✅ Prediction: Apple
📊 Confidence: 98.12%
